# Endless-Runner-Game
This repository contains my endless runner game
## Goal:
Player must go as far as he can. He should collect items and power-ups.
## Coins:
Main source for transaction(i will handle it later)
## Power-ups:
Magnet - attracts money to the player. has an effect of 15 seconds.
Shield - Adds an extra health. Taking multiple shields does not increase the health, max health can be 2.
Speeder - Player's +z velocity becomes 50 m/s for 10 seconds. increment and decrement will be gradient.
## Obstacles:
If player hit one of them and don't have a shield, he dies.
Static Obstacles - I have those assets in my previous unsuccessful project
Dynamic Obstacles - They will oscillate, turn or rotate in a loop
